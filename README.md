# FireBaseProject

This is a barebones React Native implementation of Firebase's auth feature.
It follows closely the tutorial given in this link: 
https://blog.logrocket.com/email-authentication-react-native-react-navigation-firebase/ 
by Aman Mittal.
The project includes a fully functional connection to Firebase, navigation and the ability to create an account and log in,
the components and pages are well segmented, the code is fairly clean and it builds with no problems whatsoever.
Feel free to copy the code and use on your own React Native Firebase Project.
